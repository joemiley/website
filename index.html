        <p>
            My current study is web design using all the web based technologies to better my understanding of 
            how the internet, networking, css libraries such as Bootstrap and Bulma, mobile scaling for web pages
            and everything else in the related field which is why you are seeing this web page. I have some
            knowledge of web based technologies and have created dashboards and websites before but I am seeking
            a far deeper understanding so I am currently taking a course very slowly and deliberately to not
            skip over any nuanced details. below is a link to course material I am currently working on:

        <h3>PERSONAL SUMMARY</h3>
        <hr/>
        <P>
            Currently working at a world-renowned company as a junior software engineer heading projects, 
            meeting with clients, day to day SQL (can be 50+ million rows), C#, Python, Batch, TortoiseSVN,
            GIT, Testing, ASP.Net, CSHTML, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I went to Anglia Ruskin Cambridge and 
            achieved a First honours Degree in Computer Science BEng. During my time at university I founded 
            and remained the President of the ARU Coding Society till leaving bringing likeminded students 
            together to code, problem solving and teamwork, and practising coding concepts in multiple 
            programming languages. My final year dissertation was a Python Webapp, in which I used AI and ML 
            to create and train 27 models in Tensorflow on a verified dataset of ~5000 images, comparing them 
            using the Tensorboard plugin to find the best achieving model. After this the frontend web app was
            coded using Flask (a webapp micro frame work) to classify X rays that contained Pneumonia versus 
            ones without on previously seen data. I have also done projects in Python connecting to databases 
            (SSMS mainly), dealing with missing or parsing data input, separating and connecting data from tables 
            using various joins and subqueries (though I prefer to do this at a program level versus a database 
            level for time complexity issues), and indexing (again to reduce time complexity). My Current role is 
            predominantly dealing with large SQL databases with some reaching 50 million rows of data with clients 
            from all over the world.

        <h4>ACTIVITIES</h4>
        <hr/>
        <p>
            In my spare time, I love to work on researching and understanding of programming languages for a 
            certain goal and lately that has been an aim in the real fundamentals of the programming language 
            Python3 and an in-depth look into indexing (both clustered and non-clustered) and how they work:
            Python:
            https://github.com/joemiley/Hello-world/tree/master/python/PyhtonFundamentals
            Although using Python for a number of years now I realized it was very surface level and outcome 
            driven so I was driven to rectify these issues.
            Some of my projects are as follows:

            <li>Mock database task - https://github.com/joemiley/Hello-world/tree/master/A.finished_projects/Python3_Database_Task</li>
